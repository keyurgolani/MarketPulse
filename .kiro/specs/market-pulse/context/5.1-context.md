# Task 5.1: Implement Aggressive Caching Strategy with TTL Management - Context

## Objective

Build multi-level caching with configurable TTL for different data types, cache warming, background refresh, and invalidation triggers.

## Current Analysis

- ✅ Basic TTL management exists in ApiCacheService
- ✅ Cache warming exists but needs optimization
- ❌ Missing adaptive TTL based on data type and API rate limits
- ❌ Missing background refresh mechanisms
- ❌ Missing intelligent cache warming strategies
- ❌ Missing rate limit detection and cache extension

## Implementation Tasks

1. Create enhanced TTL configuration system
2. Add adaptive TTL based on API rate limits
3. Implement background refresh mechanisms
4. Add intelligent cache warming
5. Create cache invalidation triggers
6. Add comprehensive testing

## Exit Criteria

- ✅ Multi-level caching works with different TTL strategies
- ✅ TTL management is functional and adaptive
- ✅ Cache warming is effective and optimized
- ✅ Tests are comprehensive and passing
- ✅ Performance is improved with optimal cache hit/miss ratios

## COMPLETED ✅

Task 5.1 has been successfully implemented with:

- Enhanced cache configuration system with adaptive TTL
- Multi-level caching with Redis/Memory fallback
- Intelligent cache warming with background refresh
- Rate limit detection and automatic TTL extension
- Comprehensive invalidation patterns and triggers
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Full test coverage with TypeScript safety

## Requirements Coverage

- 4.1: Configurable cache duration (minimum 1 minute)
- 4.2: Serve cached responses instead of new API calls
- 4.3: Automatic cache extension on rate limits
- 4.4: Ad-hoc cache invalidation/refresh triggers
