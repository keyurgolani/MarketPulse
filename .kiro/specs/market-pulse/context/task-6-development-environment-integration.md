## Task 6: Development Environment Integration - COMPLETED ✅

### Requirements Implemented:
- ✅ Requirement 12.1: Set up concurrent development servers for frontend and backend
- ✅ Requirement 12.4: Create npm scripts for development, testing, and building  
- ✅ Requirement 12.5: Implement pre-commit hooks with Husky and lint-staged
- ✅ Requirement 12.6: Set up test coverage reporting and quality gate enforcement
- ✅ Requirement 12.7: Create basic deployment scripts and environment validation

### Implementation Details:

#### 1. Concurrent Development Servers
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server on port 5173 with HMR
- **Backend**: Express server on port 3001 with tsx watch mode
- **Proxy Configuration**: API requests from frontend automatically proxied to backend
- **WebSocket Support**: WebSocket connections proxied for real-time features
- **Scripts**: `npm run dev` starts both servers concurrently

#### 2. Enhanced NPM Scripts
**Root Package.json Scripts:**
- `dev`: Start both frontend and backend concurrently
- `dev:client`: Frontend only
- `dev:server`: Backend only  
- `build:all`: Build both frontend and backend
- `test:all`: Run all tests with coverage
- `test:comprehensive`: Full test suite with quality gates
- `validate:env`: Environment validation
- `deploy`: Deployment with environment selection
- `setup`: Complete project setup

**Backend Package.json Scripts:**
- Enhanced test scripts with coverage thresholds (80%)
- Health check script for monitoring
- Database reset and migration scripts

#### 3. Pre-commit Hooks with Husky
**File**: `.husky/pre-commit`
- Runs lint-staged for code formatting
- Executes TypeScript type checking
- Runs quick test suite
- Enforces zero-error policy before commits
- Automatic installation via `prepare` script

**Lint-staged Configuration:**
- TypeScript files: ESLint + Prettier
- JSON/CSS/MD files: Prettier formatting
- Automatic fixing where possible

#### 4. Test Coverage and Quality Gates
**Frontend Testing (Vitest):**
- 80% coverage threshold for branches, functions, lines, statements
- HTML, JSON, and text coverage reports
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Accessibility testing with Axe

**Backend Testing (Jest):**
- 80% coverage threshold enforced
- Unit and integration test separation
- Supertest for API testing
- Coverage reports in multiple formats

**Quality Gate Enforcement:**
- Zero TypeScript errors required
- Zero ESLint warnings required
- All tests must pass
- Production build must succeed
- Browser console must be error-free

#### 5. Deployment Scripts
**File**: `scripts/deploy.sh`
- Environment-specific deployment (development, staging, production)
- Comprehensive validation pipeline
- Security audit integration
- Build artifact validation
- Backup creation for production
- Health check verification

**File**: `scripts/validate-env.sh`
- Node.js and npm version validation
- Dependency installation verification
- Environment file configuration check
- Database initialization validation
- Port availability testing
- Git hooks verification

**File**: `scripts/test-all.sh`
- 8-phase comprehensive testing pipeline
- Environment setup and validation
- Code quality checks (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)
- Unit and integration testing
- Build validation
- End-to-end testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing

#### 6. Configuration Files Created/Updated

**Playwright Configuration** (`playwright.config.ts`):
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile viewport testing
- Automatic server startup for E2E tests
- Test result reporting in multiple formats
- Global setup and teardown

**Lighthouse Configuration** (`lighthouserc.js`):
- Performance, accessibility, SEO auditing
- Multiple URL testing
- Score thresholds for quality gates
- Automated CI integration

**Environment Files**:
- Vite environment types (`src/vite-env.d.ts`)
- Backend environment template (`.env.example`)
- Development environment setup

#### 7. Test Framework Integration
**E2E Testing**:
- Playwright configuration for cross-browser testing
- Authentication flow tests
- Dashboard functionality tests
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Error handling validation

**Global Test Setup**:
- Server readiness verification
- Test user creation
- Database seeding
- Cleanup procedures

### File Locations:
- **Scripts**: `scripts/deploy.sh`, `scripts/validate-env.sh`, `scripts/test-all.sh`
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts`, `lighthouserc.js`, `vitest.config.ts`
- **Hooks**: `.husky/pre-commit`
- **Tests**: `tests/e2e/`, `tests/global-setup.ts`, `tests/global-teardown.ts`
- **Environment**: `src/vite-env.d.ts`, `server/.env`

### Key Features:
1. **Zero-Error Policy**: All quality gates must pass before commits
2. **Concurrent Development**: Frontend and backend run simultaneously
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E, accessibility, performance
4. **Environment Validation**: Automated checks for proper setup
5. **Deployment Automation**: Environment-specific deployment with validation
6. **Security Integration**: Audit checks and vulnerability scanning
7. **Coverage Enforcement**: 80% minimum coverage across all code

### Verification Results:
- ✅ Environment validation passes
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds (frontend and backend)
- ✅ Production builds complete successfully
- ✅ Development servers start correctly
- ✅ API proxy configuration works
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks execute properly
- ✅ Quality gates enforce standards

### Integration Points:
- **CI/CD Ready**: All scripts designed for automated pipeline integration
- **Docker Compatible**: Scripts work in containerized environments
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new quality gates and validation steps

### End-to-End Verification Results:
- ✅ **Frontend Server**: Vite dev server running on http://localhost:5173
- ✅ **Backend Server**: Express API server running on http://localhost:3001  
- ✅ **Database**: SQLite database connected and migrations applied
- ✅ **API Proxy**: Frontend requests properly proxied to backend
- ✅ **Authentication Flow**: Registration and login working end-to-end
- ✅ **Protected Routes**: Dashboard API endpoints secured with JWT authentication
- ✅ **Database Integration**: User registration creates default dashboard
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin requests properly handled
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and logging
- ✅ **Health Checks**: System health endpoint responding correctly

### Complete User Flow Verified:
1. **Registration**: `POST /api/auth/register` → Creates user + default dashboard
2. **Login**: `POST /api/auth/login` → Returns JWT tokens
3. **Dashboard Access**: `GET /api/dashboards` → Returns user's dashboards (authenticated)
4. **Profile Access**: `GET /api/auth/profile` → Returns user profile (authenticated)
5. **Frontend Loading**: React app loads and renders correctly
6. **API Integration**: Frontend can communicate with backend through proxy

### Status: COMPLETED ✅

The development environment integration is fully implemented and **verified end-to-end**. All components are properly connected:
- Frontend and backend servers run concurrently
- Authentication flow works from registration to dashboard access  
- Database integration is functional with proper migrations
- API endpoints are secured and responding correctly
- Development tooling enforces quality standards
- The minimal POC is working and ready for further development
