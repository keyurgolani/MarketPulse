# Task 3: Widget Framework and Components - Context

## Task Objective

Create a flexible widget framework with configurable components for displaying market data, including asset lists, grids, price tickers, watchlists, and drag-and-drop functionality.

## Requirements Coverage

- **9.1**: Configurable charts, sortable tables, and intuitive data-driven widgets
- **9.2**: Chart types, time periods, and technical indicators selection
- **9.3**: Sorting capabilities for all table columns
- **9.4**: Clear visual boundaries and distinct card layouts for widgets

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components

- ✅ Basic UI components (Button, Input, Loading, ErrorBoundary, ThemeToggle)
- ✅ Dashboard system with container and layout components
- ✅ Service layer with API clients and data services
- ✅ State management with Zustand stores
- ✅ Comprehensive widget types defined in `src/types/widget.ts`
- ✅ Widget configuration panel with schemas for all widget types
- ✅ Basic widget container with placeholder content

### Missing Components

- ❌ Actual widget implementations (only placeholders exist)
- ❌ Widget registry system
- ❌ Drag-and-drop functionality
- ❌ Real-time data integration for widgets
- ❌ Widget factory system

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Widget Framework Foundation ✅ STARTING

1. Create widget base interfaces and types (already exist)
2. Implement widget registry system
3. Build widget factory system
4. Set up widget lifecycle management

### Phase 2: Core Asset Widgets

1. Asset list widget with sorting and filtering
2. Asset grid widget with responsive layout
3. Asset detail widget with comprehensive information
4. Real-time data integration

### Phase 3: Specialized Widgets

1. Price ticker with scrolling display
2. Watchlist with user customization
3. Price alert system
4. Widget interaction handlers

### Phase 4: Drag-and-Drop System

1. Implement drag-and-drop library integration
2. Create layout management system
3. Add visual feedback and animations
4. Ensure touch device compatibility

### Phase 5: Configuration Interface

1. Widget configuration panel (already exists)
2. Real-time preview system
3. Settings persistence
4. Advanced customization options

## Context Gathered

- Backend API endpoints are available for asset data
- Real-time WebSocket service exists for live updates
- Dashboard system provides layout foundation
- UI components provide styling consistency
- State management is set up with Zustand
- Widget types and configuration schemas are comprehensive
- Test framework is robust with 513 passing tests

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Widget Framework Foundation - ✅ COMPLETED

1. **Widget Registry System**: ✅ Created widget registry to manage widget types and factories
2. **Widget Factory System**: ✅ Implemented factory pattern for widget creation with 6 specialized factories
3. **Widget Base Components**: ✅ Created base widget components with lifecycle management

### Phase 2: Core Asset Widgets - ✅ COMPLETED

1. **AssetListWidget**: ✅ Table-based widget with sorting, filtering, and real-time price updates
2. **AssetGridWidget**: ✅ Responsive grid layout widget with configurable columns and card displays
3. **PriceChartWidget**: ✅ Chart placeholder widget with timeframe selection and technical indicators support
4. **WatchlistWidget**: ✅ Interactive watchlist with add/remove functionality and search capabilities
5. **NewsFeedWidget**: ✅ News feed with filtering, search, and sentiment analysis
6. **MarketSummaryWidget**: ✅ Market indices, sectors, and commodities summary with multiple layouts

### Phase 3: Integration - ✅ COMPLETED

1. **WidgetContainer Integration**: ✅ Updated WidgetContainer to use actual widget components instead of placeholders
2. **Service Initialization**: ✅ Added widget system initialization to service provider
3. **Type Safety**: ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
4. **Build Success**: ✅ Application builds successfully

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create widget registry system
2. ✅ Implement widget factories
3. ✅ Build core asset widgets (6/6 complete)
4. ✅ Create missing widget components (NewsFeedWidget, MarketSummaryWidget)
5. ✅ Integrate widgets into WidgetContainer
6. ✅ Initialize widget system in service provider
7. ⏳ Add drag-and-drop functionality
8. ⏳ Integrate real-time data updates

## Exit Criteria

- All widget types render without errors
- Widget configuration system functions correctly
- Drag-and-drop operations work on all devices
- Real-time data updates display properly
- Widget state persists across sessions
- All tests pass with zero errors
