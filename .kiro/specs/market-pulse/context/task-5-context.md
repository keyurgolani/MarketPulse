# Task 5: Real-time Data Integration - Context

## Objective

Implement real-time data integration with WebSocket connections, multiple API key support, and automatic fallback mechanisms to meet requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation

✅ **WebSocket Infrastructure Complete**

- Frontend: `webSocketService` and `useWebSocket` hook fully implemented
- Backend: `WebSocketService` with comprehensive event handling
- Dashboard synchronization and collaborative editing features working
- Connection management, reconnection, and presence tracking implemented

✅ **Market Data Services Complete**

- `MarketDataService` with Yahoo Finance and Google Finance integration
- `YahooFinanceService` and `GoogleFinanceService` implemented
- Rate limiting and caching mechanisms in place
- API key management with `ApiKeyManager` utility

### Missing Implementation

❌ **Real-time Market Data Streaming**

- No WebSocket endpoints for market data updates
- No real-time price update mechanisms
- No subscription management for asset symbols
- No connection status indicators for market data

❌ **Multiple API Key Support with Automatic Fallback**

- Current `ApiKeyManager` supports single key per service
- No automatic key rotation on rate limits
- No fallback chain configuration
- No rate limit detection and handling

❌ **Offline Handling and Recovery**

- No offline detection mechanisms
- No cached data display during offline mode
- No data synchronization queue
- No recovery mechanisms after reconnection

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Real-time Market Data WebSocket Endpoints

1. Add market data WebSocket endpoints to backend
2. Implement real-time price streaming
3. Create subscription management system
4. Add data validation and processing

### Phase 2: Enhanced API Key Management

1. Extend `ApiKeyManager` for multiple keys per service
2. Implement automatic key rotation on rate limits
3. Add fallback chain configuration
4. Create rate limit detection and handling

### Phase 3: Connection Status and UI Updates

1. Create connection status indicator components
2. Implement real-time UI updates with throttling
3. Add visual feedback for connection states
4. Implement performance optimizations

### Phase 4: Offline Handling and Recovery

1. Add network status detection
2. Implement offline mode functionality
3. Create data synchronization queue
4. Add recovery mechanisms
