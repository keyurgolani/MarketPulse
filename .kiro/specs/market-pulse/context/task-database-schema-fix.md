# Database Schema Fix - Missing updated_at Column - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing SQLite database errors during startup and navigation:

```
SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: updated_at
UPDATE user_sessions SET token_hash = ?, expires_at = ?, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
```

The `user_sessions` table was missing the `updated_at` column that the `AuthService.updateSession` method was trying to update during token refresh operations.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The initial schema migration (001) created the `user_sessions` table without an `updated_at` column
2. **Code Expectation**: The `AuthService.updateSession` method in `server/src/services/AuthService.ts` was trying to update this non-existent column
3. **Missing Migration**: No migration existed to add the missing column to existing databases

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Migration 003

- **File**: `server/src/migrations/003_add_updated_at_to_user_sessions.ts`
- **Purpose**: Add the missing `updated_at` column to the `user_sessions` table
- **SQLite Compatibility**: Handled SQLite limitation with non-constant defaults by adding column without default, then updating existing records

### 2. Updated Migration Runner

- **File**: `server/src/scripts/migrate.ts`
- **Changes**: Added the new migration to all migration runner instances (main, status, rollback)

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage

- **Migration Tests**: `server/src/__tests__/migrations/003_add_updated_at_to_user_sessions.test.ts`
  - Tests that reproduce the original error
  - Tests that verify the migration works correctly
  - Tests that verify updates work after migration
  - Tests that existing sessions get proper `updated_at` values

- **AuthService Tests**: `server/src/__tests__/services/AuthService.updateSession.test.ts`
  - Tests that verify session updates work without database errors
  - Tests multiple session updates to ensure stability

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:

1. `server/src/migrations/003_add_updated_at_to_user_sessions.ts` - Migration to add missing column
2. `server/src/__tests__/migrations/003_add_updated_at_to_user_sessions.test.ts` - Migration tests
3. `server/src/__tests__/services/AuthService.updateSession.test.ts` - AuthService tests

### Files Modified:

1. `server/src/scripts/migrate.ts` - Added new migration to runner

## Migration Details

```sql
-- Add updated_at column (without default due to SQLite limitation)
ALTER TABLE user_sessions ADD COLUMN updated_at DATETIME;

-- Update existing records to have updated_at set to created_at
UPDATE user_sessions SET updated_at = created_at WHERE updated_at IS NULL;
```

## Test Results

- ✅ **Migration Tests**: 4/4 passing
  - Reproduces original error without migration
  - Verifies column is added correctly
  - Verifies updates work after migration
  - Verifies existing sessions get proper timestamps

- ✅ **AuthService Tests**: 2/2 passing
  - Session updates work without database errors
  - Multiple updates work correctly

- ✅ **Overall Test Suite**: 370/370 tests passing

## Verification

1. **Migration Applied**: Successfully ran `npm run migrate` and applied migration 003
2. **Application Startup**: Application now starts without database errors
3. **Token Refresh**: Token refresh operations work without SQLite errors
4. **Database Schema**: `user_sessions` table now includes `updated_at` column

## Impact

- **Fixed**: SQLite database errors during application startup and navigation
- **Improved**: Token refresh functionality now works correctly
- **Enhanced**: Database schema consistency between code expectations and actual schema
- **Added**: Comprehensive test coverage to prevent similar issues

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

The database schema issue has been fully resolved with proper migration, comprehensive tests, and successful deployment. The application now runs without the SQLite errors that were occurring during startup and navigation.
