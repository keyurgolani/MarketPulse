# Task 5.2: Add Cache Monitoring and Performance Metrics - Context

## Objective

Add comprehensive cache monitoring dashboard with performance metrics, alerting, and real-time statistics.

## Current Analysis

- ✅ CacheMonitoringService implemented with metrics collection
- ✅ Performance metrics tracking (hit rate, response time, error rate)
- ✅ Alert system with configurable thresholds
- ✅ Dashboard data aggregation with top keys and distribution
- ✅ Enhanced cache controller with monitoring endpoints
- ❌ Missing API routes for monitoring endpoints
- ❌ Missing integration with existing services
- ❌ Missing validation of monitoring functionality

## Implementation Tasks

1. Add monitoring API routes
2. Integrate monitoring service with existing cache services
3. Test monitoring endpoints
4. Validate performance metrics collection
5. Test alerting system

## Exit Criteria

- ✅ Performance metrics tracked and accessible via API
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard functional with real-time data
- ✅ Alerts configured and working properly
- ✅ API endpoints tested and documented
- ✅ Integration with existing cache services complete

## COMPLETED ✅

Task 5.2 has been successfully implemented with:

- CacheMonitoringService with comprehensive metrics collection
- Performance tracking (hit rate, response time, error rate, throughput)
- Alert system with configurable thresholds and severity levels
- Dashboard data aggregation with top keys and cache distribution
- Enhanced cache controller with monitoring endpoints
- Complete API routes for all monitoring functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage for routes and services
- Full TypeScript safety and linting compliance

## Requirements Coverage

- 4.1: Configurable cache duration monitoring ✅
- 4.2: Cache hit/miss ratio tracking ✅
- 4.3: Rate limit detection and metrics ✅
- 4.4: Cache refresh and invalidation monitoring ✅
