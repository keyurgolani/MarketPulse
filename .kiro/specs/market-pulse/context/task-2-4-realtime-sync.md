## Changes Made

### Server-Side Implementation

- **WebSocketService**: Comprehensive WebSocket server with room management, user presence, and event broadcasting
- **Dashboard Controller**: Updated to broadcast changes via WebSocket
- **Server Index**: Integrated WebSocket service with HTTP server
- **Dependencies**: Added Socket.IO server dependency

### Client-Side Implementation

- **WebSocketService**: Client-side service with connection management and event handling
- **useWebSocket Hook**: React hook for WebSocket functionality
- **useDashboardSync Hook**: Dashboard-specific synchronization logic
- **CollaborativeIndicators Component**: UI for showing collaboration status
- **Dashboard Store**: Added real-time sync methods
- **Dashboard Service**: Integrated WebSocket broadcasting
- **Dependencies**: Added Socket.IO client dependency

### Key Features Implemented

- **Real-time Dashboard Changes**: Automatic propagation of create, update, delete operations
- **Multi-device Sync**: Changes sync across all connected devices
- **User Presence**: Shows who else is viewing the same dashboard
- **Conflict Resolution**: Manual resolution when conflicts are detected
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and error handling

## Task Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All requirements for real-time synchronization have been successfully implemented:

1. **WebSocket connections** - Server and client services with automatic reconnection
2. **Change notifications** - Real-time broadcasting of dashboard changes
3. **Multi-device sync** - Cross-device synchronization with conflict resolution
4. **Collaborative editing** - User presence indicators and collaborative UI

The implementation is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, performance optimization, and full integration with the existing dashboard system.

## Notes

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing dashboard functionality
- Performance is critical - avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Error handling must be comprehensive for network issues
- Security considerations for WebSocket authentication
- Scalability considerations for multiple concurrent users
