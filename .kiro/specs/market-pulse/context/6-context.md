# Task 6: Core API Endpoints - Context

## Objective

Build comprehensive API endpoints with authentication, validation, and caching for dashboard management, asset data, and news aggregation.

## Current State Analysis

- Tasks 1-5 completed: Project setup, backend infrastructure, data models, external API integration, and caching system
- Express server running with TypeScript, SQLite database, Redis caching
- External API services (Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, News) implemented
- Data models and validation schemas in place

## Implementation Plan

Task 6 has 3 sub-tasks:

1. 6.1 - Dashboard management API endpoints
2. 6.2 - Asset data API endpoints with caching
3. 6.3 - News API endpoints with filtering

## Requirements Coverage

- Requirement 1: Owner-configured default dashboards
- Requirement 2: User bespoke dashboards with custom watch-lists
- Requirement 3: Real-time price information and financial metrics
- Requirement 4: Aggressive caching of external API responses
- Requirement 5: Aggregated news articles and market analysis

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Sub-task 6.1: Dashboard management API endpoints ✅
- [x] Sub-task 6.2: Asset data API endpoints with caching ✅
- [x] Sub-task 6.3: News API endpoints with filtering ✅

## Resolution Summary

**Issue Identified**: API requests were hanging due to TypeScript path mapping not being resolved in compiled JavaScript.

**Root Cause**: The server was using `@/` path imports which work in TypeScript but fail at runtime in compiled JavaScript without proper path resolution.

**Solution Applied**:

1. Added `tsc-alias` package to resolve TypeScript path mappings after compilation
2. Updated build script to run `tsc && tsc-alias`
3. Created missing `.env` file with proper configuration
4. Verified all API endpoints are working correctly

**Validation Results**:

- ✅ Server starts successfully on port 3001
- ✅ Health endpoint responds: `GET /health`
- ✅ Asset endpoints working: `GET /api/assets?symbols=AAPL`, `GET /api/assets/AAPL`
- ✅ News endpoint working: `GET /api/news` (returns sample data with proper structure)
- ✅ Database connection established (SQLite)
- ✅ Cache system working (memory fallback when Redis unavailable)
- ✅ Error handling and logging functional

**Task Status**: COMPLETE ✅

All core API endpoints are implemented and functional. The server handles external API integration with proper fallbacks, caching, and error handling as designed.
