# Implementation Plan

## CRITICAL: Quality Standards (MANDATORY)

**NEVER BYPASS QUALITY GUARDRAILS**: Every task must pass ALL quality gates before completion:

- ✅ All tests passing (zero failures)
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ Zero ESLint warnings
- ✅ Successful production build
- ✅ Zero runtime errors
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS**:

- ❌ Using `--no-verify` to bypass pre-commit hooks
- ❌ Committing with failing tests
- ❌ Ignoring or suppressing errors/warnings
- ❌ Modifying quality tools to be less strict
- ❌ Pushing broken code to remote repository

**RESPONSIBILITY**: Fix ALL issues in the project, regardless of origin. The codebase must be in perfect working condition after every task.

## Overview

This implementation plan follows a slice-by-slice approach where each slice represents a complete, end-to-end working feature. Each task must pass comprehensive quality gates (zero errors, zero warnings, full testing, no regression) before being committed to git.

The implementation progresses from a minimal Proof of Concept (POC) to complete feature slices, ensuring that every git commit represents a fully functional, tested, and deployable state of the application.

**Current Status**: No code implementation exists yet. Starting from scratch with complete project setup.

## File Organization and Context Management

### Context Documentation Requirements

**MANDATORY**: All task implementation summaries and agent work documentation MUST be stored in the proper context location to maintain clean project structure.

#### Context File Location Rules:

- **Task Context**: Store in `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/task-{number}-{name}.md`
- **Implementation Summaries**: Include in task-specific context files, NOT in project directories
- **Agent Work Documentation**: Store in `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/` directory only
- **Temporary Files**: NEVER commit temporary files to the project repository

#### Prohibited File Locations:

- **NEVER** create files named `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` in project directories
- **NEVER** create files with prefixes like `summary-`, `context-`, `agent-work-` in `src/`, `server/`, or root directories
- **NEVER** commit temporary files, debug files, or agent work files to production directories
- **NEVER** create files with names like `*-temp`, `*-draft`, `*-notes` in project directories

#### Required Actions After Task Completion:

1. **Create Context File**: Always create `task-{number}-{description}.md` in `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/`
2. **Document Implementation**: Include comprehensive implementation summary in context file
3. **Clean Project Directory**: Remove any temporary files created during implementation
4. **Verify Clean Structure**: Ensure project directories contain only production code and standard files

#### Context File Content Requirements:

- Task completion status and requirements mapping
- Implementation details and file locations
- Test coverage and validation results
- Key features and architectural decisions
- Requirements traceability
- Status confirmation (COMPLETED ✅)

### Project Structure Integrity

The project MUST maintain a clean, publication-ready structure at all times:

#### Production Directories (Clean Code Only):

- `src/` - Frontend production code only
- `server/src/` - Backend production code only
- `tests/` - Test files only
- `scripts/` - Build and deployment scripts only
- Root directory - Standard project files only (package.json, README.md, etc.)

#### Context and Documentation:

- `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/` - All agent work and implementation summaries
- `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/` - Spec documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
- `.kiro/steering/` - Development guidelines and standards

#### File Naming Standards:

- Context files: `task-{number}-{kebab-case-description}.md`
- No spaces, special characters, or temporary suffixes in context file names
- Use descriptive names that clearly identify the task and scope

This ensures the project remains GitHub publication-ready with a pristine, professional structure while maintaining comprehensive development context in the appropriate locations.
