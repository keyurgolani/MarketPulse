## Task Execution Guidelines

- [ ] ### Before Starting Any Task

1. **Read Detailed Task Files**: Each task references a detailed implementation file containing:
   - Comprehensive subtask breakdowns
   - Specific file creation instructions
   - Validation criteria and testing requirements
   - Git commit guidelines and milestones

2. **Context Management**
   - Check if `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/{task-number}-context.md` exists
   - If exists, load context and resume from last checkpoint
   - If not, create context file with task objective and current state analysis
   - Perform comprehensive code analysis to identify best implementation approach

3. **Dependency Verification**
   - Verify all prerequisite tasks are completed
   - Check that required infrastructure and dependencies are in place
   - Validate that previous task outputs are functioning correctly

- [ ] ### During Task Execution

- **Follow Detailed Task Files**: Use the referenced task files for step-by-step implementation guidance
- **Continuous Documentation**: Update task context file with objective, progress, and changes
- **Frequent Validation**: Run linting, compilation, build, and deployment checks after every change
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure backend-frontend integration remains aligned
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing components
- **Single Responsibility**: Break large files into single-responsibility modules
- **Code Quality**: Remove unused code and refactor for readability
- **No Duplication**: Improve existing functionality instead of creating alternatives
- **Git Commits**: Create commits at substantial milestones with conventional commit messages

- [ ] ### Task Completion Criteria

- All linting, compilation, build, and deployment errors resolved
- Application loads cleanly in production environment
- All features work as expected with proper error handling
- Browser console shows no errors
- All tests pass for implemented functionality
- Context file updated with final status
- No regression in existing functionality
- Git commit created with descriptive conventional commit message
- Working directory clean with all changes properly versioned

## Requirements Coverage

Each task maps to specific requirements from the requirements document:

- **Requirements 1-2**: Dashboard system and user customization (Tasks 2-3)
- **Requirements 3-4**: Real-time data and caching (Task 5, 8)
- **Requirement 5**: News integration (Task 6)
- **Requirements 6-8**: Accessibility and responsive design (Task 9)
- **Requirements 9-10**: UI components and feedback (Tasks 1, 4, 10)
- **Requirements 11-12**: Code quality and testing (Tasks 11, 13)
- **Requirements 13-14**: Error handling and performance (Tasks 8, 12)
- **Requirements 15-16**: Systematic testing (Task 11)

## Project Context Management

Maintain `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/project-context.md` with:

- **Command Alternatives**: Failed commands and their working alternatives
- **File Tracking**: Temporary/debug/test files and their purposes
- **Reusable Scripts**: Validation scripts that can be reused across tasks
- **Issue Solutions**: Known issues and their documented solutions
- **Code Consolidation**: Components with duplicate implementations needing consolidation

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 1**: Frontend Core Components and UI Foundation
2. **Follow Sequential Order**: Complete tasks in order due to dependencies
3. **Use Detailed Task Files**: Reference the specific task detail files for implementation guidance
4. **Maintain Context**: Keep task context files updated throughout execution
5. **Validate Continuously**: Run tests and checks after each significant change
