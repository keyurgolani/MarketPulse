## Task Execution Guidelines

### Before Starting Any Task

1. **Context Management**
   - Check if `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/{task-number}-context.md` exists
   - If exists, load context and resume from last checkpoint
   - If not, create context file with task objective and current state analysis
   - Perform comprehensive code analysis to identify best implementation approach

2. **Dependency Verification**
   - Verify all prerequisite tasks are completed
   - Check that required infrastructure and dependencies are in place
   - Validate that previous task outputs are functioning correctly

### During Task Execution

- **Continuous Documentation**: Update task context file with objective, progress, and changes
- **Quality Assurance**: Run linting, compilation, build, and deployment checks after every change
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure backend-frontend integration symmetry
- **Validation**: Use browser console logs and automated scripts for validation
- **Reference Management**: Use project context file for known issues and solutions
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing components

### Strict TypeScript Guidelines

- **Zero `any` Policy**: Never use `any` type - always identify and use correct specific types
- **Explicit Return Types**: All public functions must have explicit return types
- **Strict Null Checks**: Handle null and undefined cases explicitly
- **Type Guards**: Use type guards for runtime type checking
- **Generic Constraints**: Use extends for type safety in generics
- **Single Responsibility**: Break large files into focused, single-responsibility modules
- **Code Enhancement**: Improve existing functionality instead of creating alternatives
- **No Duplicate Files**: Never create `enhanced*`, `*v2`, `improved*`, `*-new` files
- **Single Source of Truth**: Always modify original files when enhancing functionality

### Task Completion Criteria

- **Zero Errors**: All linting, compilation, build, and deployment errors resolved
- **Production Ready**: Application loads cleanly in production (`./scripts/deploy.sh production`)
- **Full Functionality**: All features work including animations and interactions
- **Clean Console**: Browser console shows no errors or warnings
- **Test Coverage**: Tests pass for all implemented functionality
- **Documentation**: Context file updated with final status and lessons learned
- **No Regression**: Existing functionality continues to work
- **Version Control**: Git commit created with conventional commit message format
- **Clean State**: Working directory clean and changes properly versioned

### Testing and Validation Requirements

- **Systematic Testing**: Execute all applicable test categories for the task
- **Issue Tracking**: Document all problems in test-results.md with fixes
- **Zero-Error Completion**: No test marked done until fully passing
- **Regression Prevention**: Verify existing functionality after changes
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Use browser console, automated scripts, and manual testing

## Project Context Management

Maintain `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/project-context.md` with:

- **Command Alternatives**: Failed commands and their working alternatives
- **File Tracking**: Temporary/debug/test files and their purposes
- **Reusable Scripts**: Validation scripts that can be reused across tasks
- **Issue Solutions**: Known issues and their documented solutions
- **Code Consolidation**: Components with duplicate implementations needing consolidation

3. **Context Tracking**: Use individual task files for detailed implementation steps
4. **Progress Documentation**: Update context files and maintain project documentation
5. **Continuous Testing**: Run validation after each subtask completion
6. **Frequent Commits**: Create git commits at major milestones within each task
7. **Dependency Management**: Verify prerequisites before starting each task
