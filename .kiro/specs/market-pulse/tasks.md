## Task Execution Guidelines

**Before starting any task:**

1. Check if `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/{task-number}-context.md` exists
2. If it exists, load context and resume from last checkpoint
3. If not, create the context file with task objective
4. Perform comprehensive code analysis to identify best approach for implementation or potential issue spots
5. Update context file after every sub-step with progress and changes

**During task execution:**

- Update task context file continuously with objective, gathered context, and changes made
- Run linting, compilation, build, and deployment checks after every change
- Use browser console logs and Puppeteer for validation
- Ensure backend-frontend integration symmetry
- Add timeouts to commands that might hang
- Reference project context file for known failing commands and alternatives
- Follow test-driven development: write tests before implementing components
- Break large files into single-responsibility modules
- Remove unused code and refactor for readability
- **Improve existing functionality** instead of creating alternative versions (no `enhanced*`, `*v2`, `improved*` files)
- **Always modify original files** when enhancing functionality to maintain single source of truth
- **Create git commits** at substantial milestones within each task
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, refactor:, test:, docs:)

**Task completion criteria:**

- All linting, compilation, build, and deployment errors resolved
- Application loads cleanly in production (`./script/deploy.sh production`)
- All features work including animations and interactions
- Browser console shows no errors
- Tests pass for implemented functionality
- Context file updated with final status
- No regression in existing functionality
- **Git commit created** with descriptive message following conventional commit format
- Working directory clean and changes properly versioned

**Testing validation requirements:**

- **test-results.md updated** - All test outcomes documented with issues and fixes
- **Systematic test execution** - Run all applicable test categories for the task
- **Issue resolution** - All identified problems fixed and marked complete
- **Zero-error completion** - No test marked done until fully passing
- **Regression testing** - Verify existing functionality still works after changes

**Validation methodology:**

- **test-results.md tracking** - Document all testing progress and outcomes
- **Systematic test execution** - Run applicable tests from 11 test categories
- **Issue-driven development** - Log all problems, fix systematically, mark complete
- Use browser console logs and Puppeteer scripts as primary validation
- Run full test suite after each change
- Validate end-to-end application behavior
- Check responsive design across all device types
- Verify accessibility compliance
- **Zero-error policy** - No task complete until all tests pass

## Project Context File

Maintain `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/project-context.md` with:

- Commands that have failed and their working alternatives
- Temporary/debug/test files and their purposes
- Validation scripts that can be reused
- Known issues and their solutions
- Components with duplicate implementations that need consolidation
