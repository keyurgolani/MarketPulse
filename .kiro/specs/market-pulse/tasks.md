# MarketPulse Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan reflects the current state of the MarketPulse application and focuses on the remaining tasks needed to complete the requirements. The backend infrastructure, data models, and API endpoints are largely complete. The focus now is on building the frontend application and integrating it with the existing backend.

## Current Implementation Status

- [ ] ### ‚úÖ Completed Backend Infrastructure

- [x] **Project Setup**: Complete React/TypeScript/Vite setup with build tools and linting
- [x] **Backend Infrastructure**: Express.js server with comprehensive middleware, logging, and error handling
- [x] **Data Models**: SQLite database with models (User, Dashboard, Widget, Asset) and TypeScript interfaces
- [x] **External APIs**: Yahoo Finance service with rate limiting, Google Finance fallback, and news aggregation
- [x] **Caching System**: Redis with memory fallback, multi-level caching with TTL management
- [x] **API Endpoints**: Complete REST API for assets, dashboards, news, and system health
- [x] **Testing**: Backend test suite with 20+ test files covering all services

- [ ] ### üîÑ Frontend Implementation Required

The frontend currently has only a basic placeholder App.tsx. All UI components, state management, and frontend functionality need to be implemented.

## Task Execution Guidelines (Mandatory)

### Test-Driven Development Workflow

1. **Test-Results Setup**: Check if `test-results.md` exists, create if not
2. **Test Categories**: List all test types for current service state
3. **Systematic Execution**: Run tests one by one, logging results and issues
4. **Issue Tracking**: For each test, identify issues, fix them, mark as resolved
5. **Continuous Updates**: Update test results after each fix
6. **Completion Criteria**: Mark test done only when fully passing

### Before Starting Any Task

1. **Context Management**: Check if `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/{task-name}-context.md` exists
   - If exists: Load context and resume from last checkpoint
   - If not: Create context file with task objective and current state analysis
2. **Code Analysis**: Perform comprehensive code analysis to identify exact fix locations
3. **Exit Criteria**: Define crisp and clear exit criteria for the task and each sub-step
4. **Test Setup**: Ensure `test-results.md` is updated with relevant test categories
5. **TDD Preparation**: Write comprehensive tests BEFORE implementing components

### During Task Execution

1. **Context Updates**: Update task context file after every significant step
2. **Test-First Development**: Create/update test files before writing component code
3. **Continuous Testing**: Run tests after each change, update `test-results.md`
4. **Integration Checks**: Verify backend-frontend integration consistency
5. **Browser Validation**: Use browser console logs and puppeteer for validation
6. **Zero Errors Policy**: Fix all linting, compilation, build, deployment errors immediately
7. **Code Quality**: Break large files into single-responsibility modules
8. **Duplicate Elimination**: Remove duplicate implementations, create single source of truth

### Task Completion Criteria

1. **Implementation Complete**: All implementation checkboxes marked
2. **Validation Complete**: All validation checkboxes marked
3. **Tests Passing**: All relevant tests in `test-results.md` marked as done
4. **Production Ready**: `./scripts/deploy.sh production` runs successfully
5. **Browser Clean**: Application loads without console errors
6. **Features Working**: All implemented features function correctly
7. **Code Quality**: No lint warnings, no unused code, single source of truth maintained
8. **Integration Verified**: Backend-frontend integration consistent

1. **Read Detailed Task Files**: Each task references a detailed implementation file containing:
   - Comprehensive subtask breakdowns
   - Specific file creation instructions
   - Validation criteria and testing requirements
   - Git commit guidelines and milestones

2. **Context Management**
   - Check if `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/{task-number}-context.md` exists
   - If exists, load context and resume from last checkpoint
   - If not, create context file with task objective and current state analysis
   - Perform comprehensive code analysis to identify best implementation approach

3. **Dependency Verification**
   - Verify all prerequisite tasks are completed
   - Check that required infrastructure and dependencies are in place
   - Validate that previous task outputs are functioning correctly

- [ ] ### During Task Execution

- **Follow Detailed Task Files**: Use the referenced task files for step-by-step implementation guidance
- **Continuous Documentation**: Update task context file with objective, progress, and changes
- **Frequent Validation**: Run linting, compilation, build, and deployment checks after every change
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure backend-frontend integration remains aligned
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing components
- **Single Responsibility**: Break large files into single-responsibility modules
- **Code Quality**: Remove unused code and refactor for readability
- **No Duplication**: Improve existing functionality instead of creating alternatives
- **Git Commits**: Create commits at substantial milestones with conventional commit messages

- [ ] ### Task Completion Criteria

## Project Context Management

Maintain `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/project-context.md` with:

- **Command Alternatives**: Failed commands and their working alternatives
- **File Tracking**: Temporary/debug/test files and their purposes
- **Reusable Scripts**: Validation scripts that can be reused across tasks
- **Issue Solutions**: Known issues and their documented solutions
- **Code Consolidation**: Components with duplicate implementations needing consolidation

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 1**: Frontend Core Components and UI Foundation
2. **Follow Sequential Order**: Complete tasks in order due to dependencies
3. **Use Detailed Task Files**: Reference the specific task detail files for implementation guidance
4. **Maintain Context**: Keep task context files updated throughout execution
