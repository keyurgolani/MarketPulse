## Validation Commands

```bash
# Development validation
npm run dev
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm test -- --testPathPattern=animations

# Animation performance validation
npm run test:animations:performance

# Loading state validation
npm run test:loading

# Error handling validation

# Accessibility validation
npm run test:a11y:animations
```

## Animation Performance Targets

- **Frame Rate:** Consistent 60fps on desktop, 30fps minimum on mobile
- **Animation Duration:** 200-300ms for micro-interactions, 500ms max for transitions
- **Memory Usage:** No memory leaks from animation cleanup
- **CPU Usage:** <10% CPU usage for animations on mid-range devices
- **Battery Impact:** Minimal battery drain from animations on mobile

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Animation performance issues:** Use transform and opacity, avoid layout-triggering properties
2. **Layout shifts during loading:** Implement proper skeleton screens with exact dimensions
3. **Error boundary not catching errors:** Ensure error boundaries are placed at appropriate levels
4. **Reduced motion not working:** Test and implement proper prefers-reduced-motion support
5. **Memory leaks from animations:** Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
6. **Accessibility issues with animations:** Provide alternative feedback for users who can't see animations
