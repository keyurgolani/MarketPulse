# Task 5: Real-time Data Integration

**Context File:** `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/5-context.md`
**Objective:** Implement WebSocket connections and real-time data updates with offline handling
**Exit Criteria:** WebSocket client operational, real-time updates working, connection management functional, offline handling complete, tests pass
**Git Commits:** Create commits after each major milestone (WebSocket setup, real-time updates, connection management, offline handling)

## General Guidelines

**Before starting any task:**

1. Check if `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/5-context.md` exists
2. If it exists, load context and resume from last checkpoint
3. If not, create the context file with task objective
4. Perform comprehensive code analysis to identify best approach for implementation or potential issue spots
5. Update context file after every sub-step with progress and changes

**During task execution:**

- Update task context file continuously with objective, gathered context, and changes made
- Run linting, compilation, build, and deployment checks after every change
- Use browser console logs and validation for testing
- Ensure backend-frontend integration symmetry
- Add timeouts to commands that might hang
- Follow test-driven development: write tests before implementing components
- Break large files into single-responsibility modules
- Remove unused code and refactor for readability
- **Improve existing functionality** instead of creating alternative versions (no `enhanced*`, `*v2`, `improved*` files)
- **Always modify original files** when enhancing functionality to maintain single source of truth
- **Create git commits** at substantial milestones within each task
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, refactor:, test:, docs:)
