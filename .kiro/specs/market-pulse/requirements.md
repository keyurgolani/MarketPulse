# Requirements Document

## Introduction

MarketPulse is a comprehensive financial dashboard platform that enables owner-configured suite of dynamic, curated dashboards that automatically surface for every user, while also giving each user the ability to create bespoke dashboards with custom asset watch-lists. The system aggregates real-time price information, news articles, market sentiment, and ancillary financial metrics from multiple free data providers (inspired by Yahoo Finance, Google Finance and similar services) with aggressive caching to avoid API throttling. The platform features a modern, accessible design system with WCAG-AA compliance, dark-mode support, and responsive layouts optimized for all device types.
