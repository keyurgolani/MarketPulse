# Requirements Document

## Introduction

MarketPulse is a comprehensive financial dashboard platform that enables users to monitor real-time market data through owner-configured default dashboards and custom user watchlists. The platform aggregates data from multiple financial sources (Yahoo Finance, Google Finance) with aggressive caching, provides WebSocket-based real-time updates, integrates news feeds with sentiment analysis, and maintains WCAG-AA accessibility compliance throughout the user experience.

The system serves both individual investors and financial professionals who need reliable, fast, and accessible market data visualization with customizable dashboard configurations and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Implementation Strategy

**Slice-by-Slice Development Approach:**
This project will be implemented using a slice-by-slice methodology where each slice represents a complete, end-to-end working feature. Each slice must pass comprehensive quality gates (zero errors, zero warnings, full testing, no regression) before being committed to git. The implementation follows this sequence:

1. **Proof of Concept (POC)** - Minimal working end-to-end application
2. **Feature Slices** - Sequential implementation of complete features
3. **Quality Gates** - Extensive testing and validation after each slice
4. **Git Snapshots** - Clean commits only when all quality criteria are met

This approach ensures incremental progress with maintained quality standards and prevents technical debt accumulation.
