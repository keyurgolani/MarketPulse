# Task 11: Testing and Quality Assurance

**Context File:** `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/11-context.md`
**Objective:** Implement comprehensive testing suite with systematic validation and zero-error completion policy
**Exit Criteria:** All 11 test categories passing, test-results.md tracking complete, zero errors remaining, systematic validation complete
**Git Commits:** Create commits after each major milestone (test framework setup, unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, systematic validation)

## General Guidelines

**Before starting any task:**

1. Check if `.kiro/specs/market-pulse/context/11-context.md` exists
2. If it exists, load context and resume from last checkpoint
3. If not, create the context file with task objective
4. Perform comprehensive code analysis to identify best approach for implementation or potential issue spots
5. Update context file after every sub-step with progress and changes

**During task execution:**

- Update task context file continuously with objective, gathered context, and changes made
- Run linting, compilation, build, and deployment checks after every change
- Use browser console logs and validation for testing
- Ensure backend-frontend integration symmetry
- Add timeouts to commands that might hang
- Follow test-driven development: write tests before implementing components
- Break large files into single-responsibility modules
- Remove unused code and refactor for readability
- **Improve existing functionality** instead of creating alternative versions (no `enhanced*`, `*v2`, `improved*` files)
- **Always modify original files** when enhancing functionality to maintain single source of truth
- **Create git commits** at substantial milestones within each task
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, refactor:, test:, docs:)

**Task completion criteria:**

- All linting, compilation, build, and deployment errors resolved
- All 11 test categories executing and passing
- test-results.md created and tracking all testing progress
- All issues documented with specific details and resolution steps
- Zero errors remaining before marking tests complete
- Systematic problem resolution completed
- All tests pass for implemented functionality
- Browser console shows no errors
- Context file updated with final status
- No regression in existing functionality
- Git commit created with descriptive message
- Working directory clean with all changes versioned

## Systematic Testing Framework

This task implements a comprehensive testing approach using `test-results.md` for progress tracking:

- **11 test categories** covering all aspects from structure to production
- **Issue-driven development** with systematic problem resolution
- **Zero-error policy** ensuring no test is marked complete until fully passing
- **Step-by-step validation** with progress documentation
- **Regression testing** to ensure existing functionality continues working after changes
